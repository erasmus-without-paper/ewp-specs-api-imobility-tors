Incoming Mobility ToRs Get endpoint
===================================

* [What is the status of this document?][statuses]
* [See the index of all other EWP Specifications][develhub]


Summary
-------

This endpoint allows the client (usually the sending HEI) to retrieve
Transcripts of Records for specific Incoming Mobilities from the receiving HEI.


Request method
--------------

 * Requests MUST be made with either HTTP GET or HTTP POST method. Servers MUST
   support both these methods. Servers SHOULD reject all other request methods.

 * Clients are advised to use POST when passing large number of parameters
   (servers MAY set a limit on their GET query string length).


Request parameters
------------------

Parameters MUST be provided in the regular `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
format.


### `receiving_hei_id` (required)

SCHAC ID of the institution which is (or was) the receiving partner of all the
mobilities provided in `omobility_id` parameter list. This parameter MUST be
required by the server even if the server covers only a single institution.


### `omobility_id` (repeatable, required)

A list of Outgoing Mobility identifiers (max `<max-omobility-ids>` items) - IDs
of Outgoing Mobility objects for which the client wants to retrieve
corresponding Transcripts of Records. The HEI referenced in the
`receiving_hei_id` parameter must be the receiving partner of all these
mobilities (unmatched mobilities will be ignored).

This parameter is *repeatable*, so the request MAY contain multiple occurrences
of it. The server is REQUIRED to process all of them.

Server implementers provide their own chosen value of `<max-omobility-ids>` via
their manifest entry (see [manifest-entry.xsd](manifest-entry.xsd)). Clients
SHOULD parse this value (or assume it's equal to `1`).


Handling of invalid parameters
------------------------------

 * General [error handling rules][error-handling] apply.

 * Invalid (unknown) `omobility_id` values MUST be **ignored**. Servers MUST
   return a valid (HTTP 200) XML response in such cases, but the response will
   simply not contain the information on the unknown `omobility_id` values. If
   all values are unknown, servers MUST respond with an empty `<response>`
   element. This requirement is true even when `<max-omobility-ids>` is `1`.

 * If the caller doesn't have permission to view some of the ToRs corresponding
   to provided `omobility_ids`, then such `omobility_ids` MUST also be ignored,
   exactly as above. Servers MUST return a valid (HTTP 200) XML response in
   such cases.

 * Currently, clients have no way of telling the difference between "this
   `omobility_id` does not exist" and "it does exist, but you don't have access
   to it". In both cases, the proper `<tor>` element will simply be missing
   from the response.

 * If the length of `omobility_id` list is greater than `<max-omobility-ids>`,
   then servers SHOULD respond with HTTP 400. Clients SHOULD split large
   requests into a couple of smaller ones (based on the `<max-omobility-ids>`
   value obtained from the Registry).


Response
--------

Servers MUST respond with a valid XML document described by the
[get-response.xsd](get-response.xsd) schema. See the schema annotations for
further information.
